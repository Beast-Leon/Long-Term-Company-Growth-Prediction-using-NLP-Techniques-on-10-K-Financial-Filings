Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and other sections of this Report contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our business, management s beliefs, and assumptions made by management. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates, should,  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including changes in demand for our products, product mix, bidding activity, the timing of customer orders and deliveries, the price and availability of raw materials, excess or shortage of production capacity, international trade policy and regulations and other risks discussed at Item 1A under the caption Risk Factors and from time to time in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports. In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates, and general domestic and international economic conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Report. If we do update or correct one or more forward-looking statements, investors and others should not conclude that we will make additional updates or corrections with respect thereto or with respect to other forward-looking statements. Overview We are a leading North American manufacturer of large-diameter, high-pressure steel pipeline systems for use in water infrastructure applications, primarily related to drinking water systems. Our pipeline systems are also used for hydroelectric power systems, wastewater systems and other applications. We also make products for industrial plant piping systems and certain structural applications. These pipeline systems are produced by our Water Transmission Group from five manufacturing facilities strategically located across the United States in Portland, Oregon; Denver, Colorado; Adelanto, California; Parkersburg, West Virginia; and Saginaw, Texas. Our Water Transmission Group accounted for approximately 71 of net sales in 2006. Our Tubular Products Group operates two manufacturing facilities in Atchison, Kansas, and Houston, Texas and produces a range of products used in several different markets. We currently make energy pipe, fire protection sprinkler pipe, agricultural pipe, traffic signpost systems and standard pipe that is sold to distributors and used in many different applications. Our Tubular Products Group generated approximately 24 of our net sales in 2006. Our Fabricated Products Group generated the remaining 5 of our net sales in 2005. Our Fabricated Products Group primarily produces propane tanks for distribution in rural and suburban areas of the United States. These tanks range in size from 120 gallons to 1,000 gallons. All of these products are produced at our Monterrey, Mexico facility. Recently, we completed an expansion of this facility that should double its capacity. The new production lines are targeted towards manufacturing other steel or aluminum pressure vessels and fabricated parts. We have a number of projects in the prototype or trial order stages that are targeted to the energy, transportation and water industries. Our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors, who include our products in their bids to municipal agencies or privately-owned water companies for specific projects. We believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement, repair and upgrade. Within the total pipeline, our products tend to fit the larger-diameter, higher-pressure applications. We believe, because of our reputation for quality, our long relationships and our breadth of product offerings, our products are generally included in most projects for which the pipe falls within our manufacturing strengths.   19 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n  Our Tubular Products Group s sales volume is typically driven by non-residential construction spending, energy, highway spending and general economic conditions. In 2005 we began to shift the focus of our Tubular Products Group on products for which we believe we have a sustainable advantage and to reduce our reliance on products which are very susceptible to import competition. This strategy resulted in lower volume in 2005, but in 2006 we were able to increase this group s sales through growth in energy products. Overall demand for our Fabricated Products Group s propane tanks is primarily driven by weather patterns and residential heating needs, construction activity, and general economic conditions. Our new products, if they develop as expected, will be sold to OEMs in the transportation, energy and water industries. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management Estimates: The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate all of our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, warranties, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, income taxes, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition: Revenue from construction contracts in our water transmission segment is recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs of each contract. Estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all projects that are fifty percent or more complete except that major projects, usually over 5.0 million, are reviewed earlier if sufficient production has been completed to provide enough information to revise the original estimated total cost of the project. All cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by greater than one percent are reviewed by senior management personnel. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation. Selling, general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known. Changes in job performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Historically, actual results have been within management s estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors. Revenue from our tubular products and fabricated products segments is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and from contract disputes. The extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit     20 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n rating reports or financial information of a potential customer. Trade receivable balances are evaluated at least monthly. If it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us as a result of a bankruptcy filing, deterioration in the customer s financial position, contract dispute, product claim or other similar events, a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the expected recovery amount given all information presently available. A general allowance is recorded for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers. As of December 31, 2006, the accounts receivable balance of 68.4 million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of 823,000. We believe the reported allowances at December 31, 2006, are adequate. If the customers financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may need to be recorded, which would result in additional selling, general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made. Historically, actual results have been within management s estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors. Goodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with all acquisitions. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We review for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit that includes goodwill, as measured by discounted cash flows, market multiples based on earnings, and other valuation methodologies, to the carrying value. As required under SFAS 142, we performed our annual assessment for impairment of the goodwill as of December 31, 2006; based on our analysis, we believe no impairment of goodwill exists. Long-Lived Assets: Property and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We assess impairment of property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. The recoverable value of long-lived assets is determined by estimating future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance. Our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, or changes to our business operations. If we determine the carrying value of the property and equipment will not be recoverable, we calculate and record an impairment loss. Effective January 1, 2006, we elected to change our accounting method related to depreciation of certain equipment from the straight-line method of depreciation to the units of production method of depreciation, which is considered a preferable method of accounting for such long-lived, nonfinancial assets. We have determined this change to be preferable under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States as it more accurately reflects the pattern of consumption of the equipment. In accordance with SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3, this change, accounted for as a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle, has been applied prospectively. Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Finished goods and Tubular Products and Fabricated Products raw material are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out method of accounting. Raw material inventories of steel coil are stated at cost on a specific identification. Raw material inventories of coating and lining materials, as well as materials and supplies, are stated on an average cost basis.   21 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n  Product Warranties: Our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for our products to be free of certain defects. We record a general reserve for warranty claims based on historical experience. If actual warranty claims differ from our estimates, revisions to the reserve would be necessary. Income Taxes: We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Self Insurance: We are self-insured for a portion of losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation claims at our West Virginia facility. Losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry. We have purchased stop-loss coverage in order to limit, to the extent practical, the aggregate exposure to claims. There is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences. Pension Benefits: We have two defined benefit pension plans that are frozen. We fund these plans to cover current plan costs plus amortization of the unfunded plan liabilities. To record these obligations, management uses estimates relating to assumed inflation, investment returns, mortality, employee turnover, and discount rates. Management, along with third-party actuaries, reviews all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis. Results of Operations The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of our business segments. \\n\\n Year Ended December 31, \\n\\n 2006 \\n\\n 2005 \\n\\n 2004 \\n\\n Net sales: \\n\\n Water transmission     70.6 \\n\\n 70.6 \\n\\n 60.9 \\n\\n Tubular products     24.5 \\n\\n 24.5 \\n\\n 35.1 \\n\\n Fabricated products     4.9 \\n\\n 4.9 \\n\\n 4.0 \\n\\n Total net sales     100.0 \\n\\n 100.0 \\n\\n 100.0 \\n\\n Cost of sales     83.6 \\n\\n 83.7 \\n\\n 83.1 \\n\\n Gross profit     16.4 \\n\\n 16.3 \\n\\n 16.9 \\n\\n Selling, general and administrative expenses     7.9 \\n\\n 8.0 \\n\\n 7.9 \\n\\n Gain on sale of assets     (2.2) \\n\\n Operating income     10.7 \\n\\n 8.3 \\n\\n 9.0 \\n\\n Interest expense, net     1.9 \\n\\n 2.2 \\n\\n 2.2 \\n\\n Income before income taxes     8.8 \\n\\n 6.1 \\n\\n 6.8 \\n\\n Provision for income taxes     3.0 \\n\\n 2.0 \\n\\n 2.6 \\n\\n Net income     5.8 \\n\\n 4.1 \\n\\n 4.2 \\n\\n Segment gross profit as a percentage of net sales: \\n\\n Water transmission     19.0 \\n\\n 20.1 \\n\\n 19.0 \\n\\n Tubular products     10.5 \\n\\n 7.0 \\n\\n 14.6 \\n\\n Fabricated products     6.9 \\n\\n 8.6 \\n\\n 3.7 \\n\\n 22 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n  Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net sales. Net sales increased to 346.6 million in 2006 from 329.0 million in 2005. No single customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in 2006 or 2005. Water Transmission sales increased 5.5 to 244.8 million in 2006 from 232.1 million in 2005. Net sales increased over the same period last year as a result of increased volume, which is attributable to stronger demand that began in the second quarter of 2006 and continued through the end of 2006. In addition to increased sales, the stronger demand resulted in a record backlog at December 31, 2006 of 198.2 million, as compared to the backlog of 125.6 million at the beginning of 2006. Bidding activity, backlog and sales resulting from the award of new projects, or the production of current projects, may vary significantly from period to period. Tubular Products sales increased 5.1 to 84.8 million in 2006 from 80.7 million in 2005 . The majority of the increase in net sales over last year resulted from improved energy product sales. Fabricated Products sales increased 4.8 to 17.0 million in 2006 from 16.2 million in 2005. The increase in net sales was a result of increased demand for our propane tank products in the first nine months of the year, offset slightly by a drop in demand in the last quarter of 2006. Gross profit. Gross profit increased to 56.7 million (16.4 of total net sales) in 2006 from  53.8 million (16.3 of total net sales) in 2005. Water Transmission gross profit decreased slightly to 46.6 million (19.0 of segment net sales) in 2006 from 46.8 million (20.1 of segment net sales) in 2005. Our Water Transmission gross profit and our gross profit as a percent of segment net sales decreased as a result of product mix. Unlike 2005, where the market was strong in the first half of the year and began to soften in the second half of 2005, 2006 saw a continuation of a relatively slower market though much of the first half of 2006 and then a strengthening in the second half of 2006. Historically, during periods of slow or slowing markets, we see a much more competitive bidding environment. As a result, the projects that were booked during the later part of 2005 and through much of the first half of 2006 were at lower margins and the majority of these projects were produced in 2006. Gross profit from Tubular Products increased 58.5 to 8.9 million (10.5 of segment net sales) in 2006 from 5.6 million (7.0 of segment net sales) in 2005. Our Tubular Products gross margin percentage increased from the same period last year primarily because of the shift from products that competed directly with imported tubing, to products that we believe have a sustainable competitive market advantage. Fabricated Products gross profit decreased to 1.2 million (6.9 of segment net sales) in 2006 from 1.4 million (8.6 of segment net sales) in 2005. Fabricated Products gross profit decreased over the same period last year due to lower volume in the fourth quarter and the inability to pass on the higher cost of steel to our customers in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.1 to 27.4 million (7.9 of total net sales) in 2006 from 26.3 million (8.0 of total net sales) in 2005. The majority of the increase resulted from an increase in incentive compensation and the expensing of stock options that was required beginning on January 1, 2006. Gain on the sale of assets. On May 31, 2006, we completed the sale of our manufacturing facility in Riverside, California, included in Assets Held for Sale at December 31, 2005. A gain of 7.7 million was recorded. Interest expense. Interest expense decreased from 7.4 million in 2005 to 6.7 million in 2006. The decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average outstanding borrowings. Income taxes. Our effective tax rate was approximately 33.9 in 2006 and 33.4 in 2005. The effective tax rates in 2005 and 2006 were lower than historical effective rates. The decrease in our 2006 effective tax rate was     23 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n mainly due to research and development tax credits that were recorded on amended income tax returns. The decrease in our 2005 effective tax rate was due to changes in Section 199 manufacturing deductions, changes in state apportionment factors, and the resolution of previously uncertain tax matters. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net sales. Net sales increased to 329.0 million in 2005 from 291.9 million in 2004. No single customer accounted for 10 or more of total net sales in 2005 or 2004. Water Transmission sales increased 30.6 to 232.1 million in 2005 from 177.8 million in 2004. Net sales increased over the same period in 2004 as a result of increased volume, which was attributable to stronger demand. Our Water Transmission business is impacted by infrastructure improvements; as municipal water agencies initiate improvements, we generally experience an increase in demand for our products. In addition to increased sales, the stronger demand resulted in a consistently strong backlog at December 31, 2005 of 125.6 million, as compared to the backlog of 128.9 million at the beginning of 2005. Tubular Products sales decreased 21.3 to 80.7 million in 2005 from 102.5 million in 2004 . The decrease in net sales over the same period in 2004 was expected, as the strong market conditions experienced in 2004 could not be sustained. Volume decreased in 2005 as we focused our efforts on products we believed offered the opportunity for sustainable profitability, and did not directly compete with low cost imports. Fabricated Products sales increased 39.9 to 16.2 million in 2005 from 11.6 million in 2004. The increase in net sales was attributable to improved demand, which allowed for an increase in sales prices, and a small increase in market share. Gross profit. Gross profit increased to 53.8 million (16.3 of total net sales) in 2005 from 49.3 million (16.9 of total net sales) in 2004. Water Transmission gross profit increased 38.1 to 46.8 million (20.1 of segment net sales) in 2005 from 33.9 million (19.0 of segment net sales) in 2004. Our Water Transmission gross profit improved as our production continued to be strong throughout the year, and we were able to take advantage of consistent higher plant utilization. Gross profit from Tubular Products decreased 62.4 to 5.6 million (7.0 of segment net sales) in 2005 from 15.0 million (14.6 of segment net sales) in 2004. Our Tubular Products gross margin percentage decreased from the same period in 2004 primarily because, as selling prices stabilized, our cost of goods sold increased because of high cost steel, which reduced our margin. Fabricated Products gross profit increased to 1.4 million (8.6 of segment net sales) in 2005 from 435,000 (3.7 of segment net sales) in 2004. Fabricated Products gross profit increased over the same period in 2004 due to increased volume combined with better productivity in our operations, and higher selling prices during 2005 as compared to 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13.8 to 26.3 million (8.0 of total net sales) in 2005 from 23.1 million (7.9 of total net sales) in 2004. While the increase was consistent with the increase in sales, specific factors affecting the increase in expenses included an increase in incentive compensation, and an increase in information systems costs due to our system upgrade completed in 2005. Interest expense. Interest expense increased to 7.4 million in 2005 from 6.3 million in 2004. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in both our outstanding borrowings and the rates on those borrowings.   24 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n  Income taxes. Our effective tax rate was approximately 33.4 in 2005 and 37.6 in 2004. The decrease in our effective tax rate was due to changes in Section 199 manufacturing deductions, changes in state apportionment factors, and the resolution of previously uncertain tax matters. Liquidity and Capital Resources We generally finance our operations through cash flows from operations and available borrowings. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of 4.3 million and available borrowings of 26.1 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was 2.0 million. This was primarily the result of our net income of 20.0 million, non-cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of 3.8 million, an increase in accounts payable of 22.0 million, offset by non-cash adjustments for the deferred gain on sale-leaseback of equipment and a gain from the sale of property and equipment of 1.3 and 8.2 million, respectively, and an increase in inventories of 30.1 million and an increase in trade and other receivables, net of 2.5 million. The increase in inventories and accounts payable resulted primarily from an increase in steel shipments from our vendors at the end of 2006 to support the increase in the production of our Water Transmission Group. Net cash used in investing activities in 2006 was 48.0 million, which resulted from paying off the majority of our operating leases with resultant additions of property and equipment, offset by 10.4 million in proceeds, primarily from the sale of the Riverside property and equipment in May of 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 was 50.2 million, which primarily resulted from proceeds of 53.6 million from a follow-on stock offering that was completed in November 2006 and option exercises, net payments of 5.3 million on our long-term debt agreements and 1.6 million net borrowings on our line of credit to a financial institution. In November of 2006 we sold 1,955,000 shares and raised 53.1 million after underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses. The proceeds were used to payoff the operating leases mentioned above and lower our borrowings on our credit agreement. Cash and cash equivalents increased from 133,000 as of December 31, 2005 to 4.3 million as of December 31, 2006. The increase is a result of cash receipts that had not been applied to our outstanding line of credit balance. We had the following significant components of debt at December 31, 2006: a 65.0 million credit agreement, under which 43.0 million was outstanding, against which 4.1 million in cash receipts had not yet been applied to the outstanding balance;  8.6 million of Series B Senior Notes; 5.0 million of Senior Notes; 15.0 million of Series A Term Note, 10.5 million of Series B Term Notes, 10.0 million of Series C Term Notes, 4.5 million of Series D Term Notes and a 4.0 million Industrial Revenue Bond. The credit agreement expires on May 20, 2010. The balance outstanding under the credit agreement bears interest at rates related to LIBOR plus 0.75 to 1.50 , or the lending institution s prime rate, minus 0.5 to 0.0 . We had 43.0 million outstanding under the line of credit bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 6.91 , against which  4.1 million in cash receipts had not yet been applied to the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006 we had an additional net borrowing capacity under the line of credit of 26.1 million. The Series A Term Note in the principal amount of 15.0 million matures on February 25, 2014 and requires annual payments in the amount of 2.1 million that begin February 25, 2008 plus interest of 8.75 paid quarterly on February 25, May 25, August 25 and November 25. The Series B Term Notes in the principal amount of 10.5 million mature on June 21, 2014 and require annual payments in the amount of 1.5 million that begin June 21, 2008 plus interest of 8.47 paid quarterly on March 21, June 21, September 21 and December 21. The Series C Term Notes in the principal amount of 10.0 million mature on October 26, 2014 and require annual payments of 1.4 million that begin October 26, 2008 plus interest of 7.36 paid quarterly on     25 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n January 26, April 26, July 26 and October 26. The Series D Term Notes in the principal amount of 4.5 million mature on January 24, 2015 and require annual payments in the amount of 643,000 that begin January 24, 2009 plus interest of 7.32 paid quarterly on January 24, April 24, July 24, and October 24. The Series B Senior Notes in the principal amount of 8.6 million mature on April 1, 2008 and require annual payments of 4.3 million that began April 1, 2002 plus interest at 6.91 paid quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The Senior Notes in the principal amount of 5.0 million mature on November 15, 2007 and require annual payments in the amount of 5.0 million that began November 15, 2001 plus interest of 6.87 paid quarterly on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15. The Senior Notes and Series B Senior Notes (together, the Notes also include supplemental interest from 0.0 to 1.5 (0.0 at December 31, 2006), based on our total minimum net earnings before tax plus interest expense (net of capitalized interest expense), depreciation expense and amortization expense EBITDA to total debt leverage ratio, which is paid with the required quarterly interest payments. The Industrial Revenue Bond in the principal amount of 4.0 million matures on July 1, 2016 and requires monthly principal and interest payments, at 5.22 , in the amount of 50,000 that begin February 1, 2007. The Notes, the Series A Term Note, the Series B Term Notes, the Series C Term Notes, and the Series D Term Notes (together, the Term Notes and the credit agreement are collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory and certain equipment.  We lease certain equipment used in the manufacturing process. The aggregated interest rate on the capital leases is 5.2 . The following table sets forth our commitments under the terms of our debt obligations and operating leases: \\n\\n Total     2007     2008 / 2009     2010 / 2011     Thereafter     Credit Agreement \\n\\n 43,000 \\n\\n 43,000 \\n\\n The Notes \\n\\n 13,571 \\n\\n 9,286 \\n\\n 4,285 \\n\\n The Term Notes \\n\\n 40,000 \\n\\n 10,786 \\n\\n 11,428 \\n\\n 17,786     Capital Leases \\n\\n 4,007 \\n\\n 378 \\n\\n 873 \\n\\n 969 \\n\\n 1,787     Operating Leases \\n\\n 7,973 \\n\\n 2,758 \\n\\n 3,027 \\n\\n 1,134 \\n\\n 1,054     Interest Payments (1) \\n\\n 16,825 \\n\\n 4,239 \\n\\n 6,155 \\n\\n 4,056 \\n\\n 2,375 \\n\\n Total Obligations \\n\\n 125,376 \\n\\n 16,661 \\n\\n 25,126 \\n\\n 60,587 \\n\\n 23,002 \\n\\n (1)   These amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations, excluding the Credit Agreement. We also have entered into stand-by letters of credit that total approximately 15.0 million as of December 31, 2006. The stand-by letters of credit relate to customer owned material, workers compensation and general liability insurance. Due to the nature of these arrangements and our historical experience, we do not expect to make any significant payments under these arrangements. Therefore, they have been excluded from our aggregate commitments identified above. The credit agreement, the Notes, the Term Notes and Industrial Revenue Bond all require compliance with the following financial covenants: minimum consolidated tangible net worth, maximum consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio. These and other covenants included in our financing agreements impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations, and place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances on assets and capital expenditures. A failure by us to comply with the requirements of these covenants, if not waived or cured, could permit acceleration of the related indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that include cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. At December 31, 2006, we were not in violation of any of the covenants in our debt agreements.   26 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n  We expect to continue to rely on cash generated from operations and other sources of available funds to make required principal payments under the Notes during 2007. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated by operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. To the extent necessary, we may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings, senior notes, term notes and capital and operating leases, if such resources are available on satisfactory terms. We have from time to time evaluated and continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion. Any such transactions, if consummated, may use a portion of our working capital or necessitate additional bank borrowings. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Other than non-cancelable operating lease commitments, we do not have off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose entities. Related Party Transactions We have ongoing business relationships with certain affiliates of Wells Fargo Company Wells Fargo ). Wells Fargo, together with certain of its affiliates, owns more than ten percent of our outstanding stock. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we made payments to affiliates of Wells Fargo for operating lease payments, pursuant to which we lease certain equipment from such affiliates. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we made the following payments to affiliates of Wells Fargo: (i) capital and operating lease payments pursuant to which the Company leases certain equipment from such affiliates, (ii) payments of interest and fees pursuant to letters of credit originated by such affiliates, (iii) payments of principal and interest on an industrial development bond, and (iv) payments of principal, interest and related fees in connection with loan agreements between the Company and such affiliates. Payments made by us to Wells Fargo and its affiliates amounted to 396,000, 3.3 million and 3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Balances due to Wells Fargo and its affiliates were 0 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159 ). SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 seeks to improve the overall quality of financial reporting by providing companies the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are assessing SFAS 159 and have not determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 159 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) SFAS 158 ). SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit post-retirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position. Further, SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. SFAS 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In September 2006, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108 ). SAB 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify     27 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n financial statement misstatements. Traditionally, there have been two widely-recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements: the roll-over method and the iron curtain method. The roll-over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement, including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements, but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet. The iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period-end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact that the adoption of SAB 108 had on our financial position. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157 ). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy (i.e., levels 1, 2, and 3, as defined). Additionally, companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding instruments in the level 3 category, including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are assessing SFAS 157 and have not determined the impact that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 FIN 48 ). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are assessing FIN 48 and have not determined the impact that the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF related to EITF Issue No. 06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation) EITF 06-3 ). EITF 06-3 concludes that the presentation of any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer, and may include, but is not limited to, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes on either a gross basis (included in revenues and costs) or a net basis (excluded from revenues) is an accounting policy that should be disclosed. In addition, for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis, an entity should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant. The provisions of EITF 06-3 should be applied to financial reports for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2006, with earlier adoption permitted. We do not believe that the adoption of EITF 06-3 will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In June 2006, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF related to EITF Issue No. 06-5 Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance EITF 06-5 ), which requires that a policyholder consider additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the life insurance policy. EITF 06-5 provides additional guidance for determining the amount to be realized, including the policy level for which the analysis should be performed, amounts excluded and measurement criteria. EITF 06-5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are assessing EITF 06-5 and have not determined the impact that the adoption of EITF 06-5 will have on our financial position or results of operations.   28 \\n\\n Table of Contents \\n\\n\\n'"
